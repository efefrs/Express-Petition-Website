To run this program should be fairly simple.

I personally am using vscode for testing/programming. 
To run this program I make a new terminal in vscode and type nodemon into the terminal.
That should start everything and allow you to test from there.

Note that node_modules has been left empty. You may need to 'npm install' a few things:
'http-errors'
'sequelize'
'sqlite3'

But you should try to type 'nodemon' first and see if any errors occur.
